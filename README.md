# HPC Scale

This project contains a series of samples using MPI + pthreads (hybrid MPI),
for testing scaling on HPC architectures at very large node and core numbers.

## Build instructions
Make sure you have a C99 complient compiler available â€” then call the build script with either `debug` or `release`:

`./build.sh release`

## HPC Specific scripts
Different HPC architectures have different configurations.
We currenly provide scripts for the following HPC architectures.
